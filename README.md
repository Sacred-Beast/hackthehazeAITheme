## 💼 Problem Statement

> Build an intelligent, personalized, and scalable **AI-powered career guidance system** for the Indian education ecosystem.
> Your engine should analyze **aptitude, goals, skills, and experience** to recommend optimal **career paths** aligned with Indian academic streams (CBSE/ICSE/State Boards), national-level exams (UPSC, NEET, JEE, CA, etc.), and job market trends.

You're not just building a tool — you're shaping the future of **career discovery and educational planning** in India.

---

## 🔍 Objectives

* Predict **natural aptitude** using ML from test scores or behavioral patterns.
* Extract **goals and interests** using NLP from text/audio inputs.
* Map **skills and experiences** using embeddings and match with industry profiles.
* Recommend personalized **career paths** based on Indian education routes and competitive exams.
* Suggest **learning pathways** based on skill gap analysis (aligned with NEP & current job demands).

---

## 🧠 Core AI Features

* 📊 **Aptitude Prediction** (ML Regression/Classification)
* 🧠 **Goal Extraction** (NLP on text/audio responses)
* 🧩 **Skill Mapping** (Embeddings / Semantic Similarity)
* 🔁 **Career Recommendation Engine** (Supervised/Unsupervised Learning)
* 🧮 **Skill Gap Analysis & Learning Suggestions**

---

## 🎨 Suggested Enhancements

* 📈 Interactive dashboards for results
* 🎙️ Voice/text-based user inputs (with NLP support)
* 🌍 Regional language support (IndicNLP/AI4Bharat)
* 🔎 Resume/LinkedIn scraping (optional)
* 📚 NEP-based course suggestions (Coursera, SWAYAM, etc.)
* 🔄 Real-time recommendation updates as user progresses

---

## 🧰 Recommended Stack

* **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js, or Flutter Web
* **Backend**: Node.js / Python (FastAPI preferred)
* **ML/NLP**: scikit-learn, spaCy, Transformers, sentence-transformers
* **Data Storage**: Firebase / MongoDB / PostgreSQL
* **Deployment**: Vercel, Netlify, or Streamlit Cloud
* **Design Tool**: Figma / Canva for UX workflows
